Why we need spark stream as we are having other tehnologies
SparkStream handle the straggler node very well. straggler node are those which are slow and responsible for slow data movement in cluster.

Spark stream use the same engine for batch and strream processing, so it benefit , we can process batch and stream in same program.

data breaks in rdd's and task assign to diff node/machines. data assign most frequently to faster node as compare to straggler nodes.
